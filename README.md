# Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) - Working Principle

## 1. Overview
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) integrate deep learning with physical principles by encoding partial differential equations (PDEs) as constraints in the neural network training process.

## 2. Core Mechanism
### Neural Network Architecture

$$ u(x;\theta) = \text{MLP}(x) $$

Where $x$ is input variable and $\theta$ represents network parameters.

### Loss Function Components
1. ​**PDE Residual**:

$$ L_{PDE} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N |F(u(x_i;\theta))|^2 $$

2. ​**Boundary Condition Residual**:

$$ L_{BC} = \frac{1}{M}\sum_{j=1}^M |u(x_j;\theta)-g(x_j)|^2 $$

**Total Loss**:

$$ L = L_{PDE} + L_{BC} $$

## 3. Key Features
- Handles high-dimensional problems without mesh generation
- Naturally accommodates nonlinear physics
- Requires less training data than pure data-driven approaches

PINNs are hybrid models that combine neural networks with physical laws expressed as PDEs. The network learns to approximate solutions while being constrained by:
1. Governing equations (through $L_{PDE}$)
2. Boundary/initial conditions (through $L_{BC}$)

Key advantages include:
- Mesh-free operation
- Ability to solve inverse problems
- Data efficiency compared to purely data-driven approaches
